🌿 Sustainable Products Analyzer – Final Year Project (FYP)

👋 About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate and environmentally conscious software developer currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm deeply interested in creating innovative digital solutions that make a real-world impact, particularly in the area of sustainability and green technology.

This Final Year Project reflects both my technical skills and my commitment to helping people make more eco-friendly choices in their daily lives. With this app, I hope to raise awareness and empower users to opt for products that are better for the planet. 💚

📱 Project Overview: Sustainable Products Analyzer

**Sustainable Products Analyzer** is a mobile app that helps users evaluate the environmental impact of various products—starting with vehicles and expanding to other categories.

🔍 Key Features

- **Sustainability Score Calculation:**  
  Each product is assessed based on production emissions, use-phase emissions, lifetime, and recycling rate, giving users a clear, easy-to-understand sustainability score.

- **Product Comparison:**  
  Users can compare sustainable ratings and choose between buying from us or redirecting to a third-party seller.

- **Modern UI/UX:**  
  Built using **React Native** with a clean, user-friendly interface.

- **Real-Time Data:**  
  Powered by **Supabase** for real-time fetching and scalability.

🧪 How It Works

The sustainability score is calculated using the following criteria:

- **Production Emissions:** CO₂ emissions during manufacturing.
- **Use-Phase Emissions:** Emissions during the product’s usable life.
- **Recycling Rate:** How much of the product can be recycled.

These are plugged into a formula that normalizes the overall environmental impact on a scale from 0 to 100. The lower the score, the better the sustainability.
